## Exceptional Model Mining meets Multi-objective Optimization

**Day and Time**: January 22021, 13h

**Abstract** : 

Exceptional Model Mining (EMM) is a local pattern mining framework that generalizes subgroup discovery. In EMM, we look for subsets of objects - subgroups - whose model deviates significantly from the same model fitted on the overall dataset. Multi-objective Optimization (MOO) is an area of Multiple Criteria Decision Making where two or more functions need to be optimized at the same time and the goal is to find the best compromise between the concurrent objectives. We introduce a new model class for EMM in a MOO setting called Exceptional Pareto Front Mining. We design fitting quality measures that take into account both the difference between models and the relevance of the subgroups and study the discovery of skyline patterns according to said measures. We propose beam search based algorithms for EMM whose added-value is studied on both synthetic and real life datasets. Among others, we discuss a use case on hyperparameter optimization in machine learning for both regression and multi-label classification.
